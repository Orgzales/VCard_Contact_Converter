# VCard_Contact_Converter
Windows Contact Vcard -> Iphone I Cloud VCard 

Created Code to take the following process more simple when over 300 contacts are needed

Windows -> IMport from CSV -> Import contacts by Comma, First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone #
Export file explorer -> Export as VCARD -> Saved each contact (Can put each one in a long list still works)
Run contact in notepad Text in Python Code -> Drag new Text into Vcard and save -> Import in Icloud
